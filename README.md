# Predicting change in house price index

This is my masters thesis project.

Abstract:
This study aims to predict the change in house prices
as more transactions are received using machine learning with previous transactions and macroeconomic data as predictors. The machine learning models selected are support vector regressor,
multilayer perceptron, recurrent neural network, and long-short term memory network where the results
showed that long-short term memory neural networks provided in the lowest RMSE when trained both
with and without historic data and predicts more accurately than the stated base predictions.
